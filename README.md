# KRemote
KRemote allows to use a Japanase Remote with Karoo, Kremote only can simulated physical karoo buttons. This app doesn't need karoo SDK because use android standard availability services.

## Requirements
- Japanesse Remote
- Karoo (tested on last Karoo).

## Installation
- It's necessary to sideload this app to karoo.
- It's necessary to allow availability services, without them this app won't work.
- Press any button in the Remote to connect, you only need to open this app the first time.Kremote auto-starts when Karoo starts, then push a button in GRemote and wait until the Remote flashing green several times.

## Instructions
App autostarts every time and you only need to allow availability services first time.


## Buttons
Apps is configured by default:

- Left Button =>> Back Button (several actions, depends on the current Karoo screen.. back, zoom leveletc).
- Right Button ==> Next screen or item. 
- Upper Button ==> Zoom IN or Enter (depends on the Karoo screen)

## Know Bugs
- Sometimes app isn't working fine. You've to stop de app and start again.
- Sometimes screens change fast or several times. I'll try to improve this in next versions, but it's not a big issue now.
- APP DOESN'T WORK IF YOU DON'T ALLOW AVAILABILITY SERVICES. If you forgot it, you can solve (easy method) reinstalling and reopen the app (and allow the availability)
## Other
Remote only works in Ride App (this is done programmatically)
